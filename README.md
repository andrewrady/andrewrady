### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:rocket: My name is Andrew Rady, [@nodevemberJS](https://twitter.com/nodevemberJS) on Twitter. I'm a software engineer who enjoys building application to solve business and people problems.
I primarly work with C#, Typescript, and have experience in Azure here at RItter Insurance Marketing. 

:microscope: My main personal project is to build a workable development enviornment for C# in Neovim. I'll be documenting the setup in my blog.

:palm_tree: Outside of work I enjoy reading, spending time outdoors, playing video games, and spening time with family. 

:book: I love reading, and fantasy is one of my favorite genre. Currently, I'm going down the Cosmere rabbit hole from Brandon Sanderson.

I have a [blog](https://andrewrady.github.io/) where I write about different side projects and what I've learned from them. 
I have also contributed to [RIMdev](https://rimdev.io/authors/andrew-rady/) blog where I have mainly wrote about my front end work.
